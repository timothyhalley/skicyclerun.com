    On September 12, 1962, a warm and sunny day, President Kennedy delivered his speech before a crowd of
    about 40,000 people, at Rice University's Rice Stadium. Many individuals in the crowd were Rice University
    students. The middle portion of the speech has been widely quoted:
    
    - We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and
    they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all
    technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man,
    and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean
    will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war. I do not say that we should or will go unprotected
    against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea,
    but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the
    mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours. There is no strife, no prejudice,
    no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best
    of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. **But why, some say, the Moon?**
    Why choose this as our goal?
    And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain?
    Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?
    **We choose to go to the Moon.**
    We choose to go to the Moon...
    We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy,
    but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our
    energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are
    unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.
