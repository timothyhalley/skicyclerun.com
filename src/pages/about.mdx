I've been a principal architect at large Fortune listed companies for over 30 years.
As a technology professional with  years of experience in delivering software and
integration solutions for various business domains, such as CRM, ERP, e-commerce,
diagnostics, and oil and gas related IT systems. I have led and mentored multiple
teams across the globe using Agile and corporate best practices. I have strong skills
and experience in programming, team alignment, system design, process optimization,
and performance testing. I am a critical thinker who can solve complex problems and
align them with business objectives. For the last 5 years I have spent as a Enterprise
Architect on the harmonization of internal and external services for a large software
cloud company based in Germany.

While not in my office, I'm at my outdoor office: SKIING, CYCLING, and HIKING/RUNNING whenever I can.
