The allure of cruise ships—the floating buffets, the endless booze,
and the overly loud games where the stakes are higher than the waves.
Alas, we’ve decided to keep our land legs intact. Perhaps we’ll stick
to exploring on foot & bike, where the only buffet is at the local
bakery, and the cruise directors don’t double as dance instructors.

Fair winds to you, though!
