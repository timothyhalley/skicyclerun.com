1. What Is SVG?
  - SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It’s a web standard used to define vector-based graphics within web pages.
  - Unlike raster images (such as JPEG or PNG), SVGs are resolution-independent. They maintain crisp quality regardless of their size or display context.
  - SVGs are based on XML and provide markup to describe paths, shapes, and text within a viewport1.
2. Why Use SVGs?
  - Frontend Optimization: Replacing other image formats with SVGs reduces file size and improves website performance. Inline SVGs don’t require additional HTTP requests.
  - Responsive Design: SVGs can adapt to various screen sizes and orientations, making them ideal for responsive web design.
  - Consistency: However, rendering SVGs consistently across all browsers can be challenging due to differences in how browsers handle them2.
3. Rendering Differences Across Browsers:
  - While SVGs are supported on all modern browsers (including older ones like IE9), their rendering behavior varies.
  - The viewbox attribute is crucial for making SVGs responsive. It defines the coordinate system and aspect ratio.
