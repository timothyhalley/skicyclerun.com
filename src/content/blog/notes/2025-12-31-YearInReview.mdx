## ✈️ Florida Journey Begins

🗓️ Feb 12–23, 2025

### 🏖️ Fort Lauderdale, FL – Feb 12

* Arrival point into South Florida. Known for its boating canals and art deco architecture and beachfront.
* Spent the evening walking along the beach front with the moon slowly rising over the Atlantic Ocean.
* Next day, drove to Cape Coral crossing Florida. 

### 🏝️ Cape Coral, FL – Feb 13–22

* Explored the canal-lined neighborhoods and waterfront parks. A quiet base for Gulf Coast excursions for the next five days.
* Cape Coral & Punta Gorda: Known for canals and waterfront charm, these Gulf Coast towns offered a small-town feel with relatively good views and restaurants.
* Played in a pickleball tournament at Cape Coral Sports Complex (less than a month old facility). We battled gale-force winds as well as opponents. 🌬
* Entered another tournament in Punta Gorda, only to face the same relentless nemesis: the wind. This time, gusts reached up to 35 mph!

### 🌊 Florida Keys – Feb 17–18

* Traveled along the Overseas Hwy through Islamorada and finally to Key West, reaching the southernmost point of the continental U.S. in a covertable Mustang no less!
* Key West is an interesting place full of historic sites, and vibrant local culture and great restaurants.
* Stayed at the cozy hotel: [La Concha Key West](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/eywaw-la-concha-key-west-autograph-collection/overview/). Highly recommend this place.
* Excellent pickleball courts nearby at [Higgs Beach Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DAQtzwEg4GzgBNcW9) with all the locals and snowbird players in for the season.

### 🐎 Ocala, FL – Feb 20

* Visited the [World Equestrian Center](https://worldequestriancenter.com/), a premier venue for international equine events.
* The WSC is located in Ocala and known as the “Horse Capital of the World,” with rolling pastures and thoroughbred farms where Rick and Pam live. They gave us an incredible tour around the area.
* At the WSC, enjoyed the layout and merchandise store with an awesome cafe/coffee shop that was very well appointed.

### 🐊 Everglades Region – Feb 23

* Explored Barron River, Everglades City, and surrounding wetlands.
* Barron River & Everglades City: A gateway to the Ten Thousand Islands, rich in mangrove ecosystems and airboat adventures.
* Hiked through Big Cypress National Preserve: Spanning 729,000 acres, this wetland sanctuary is home to the endangered Florida panther and ghost orchids.
  The only thing we saw were the 🌴 Indigenous Palm Trees of the Florida Everglades.

## 🗓️ March 2025 – 📍 Kelowna, British Columbia

* Mar 19–23: A nice visit to Kelowna to check in with Adrienne and Darrell. Andrea had one of the best visits with Adrienne.
* Mar 23: Adrienne fell down at the Independent store after grocery shopping in the parking lot. She was taken to Kelowna Hospital. That week she passed away peacefully with Darrell nearby.
* Mar 28–31: Family flew and drove to Kelowna for Adrienne's wishes to have the family gather and release butterflies on Knox Mountain for her. No butterflies were available, so Andrea decided let-fly Adrienne's favorite stuffed animals instead.
* Alex stayed with Darrell for several/many days after everyone left to help him get settled.

## 📅 June 2025 – 📍 Issaquah Cascades, Kelowna & Whistler

## 📅 August 2025 – More cycling 🚴 to get ready for TransRocky Gravel Royal race

* Miles and miles around Redmond, Kirkland, Bellevue, and Issaquah. Training rides on gravel and pavement to prep for the TransRocky Gravel Royal race!
* Aug 21–25 – Off to Radium Hot Springs & Kootenay National Park, BC:
  * Drove there and back along Hwy 93 through dramatic canyons, mineral pools, and wildlife corridors. Maybe the most picturesque road I’ve been on in a long long time.
  * Three days of racing: 100K with 3K elevation gain per day. Great weather & super people running the event. Did my best, but was plagued by mechanical problems. Apparently my freehub was blown with no outer bearings—still pedaled and finished each day!
  * Best part - returning home in the best shape I've been in years!

## 📅 September 2025 – 📍 Local mountains and trails

* Hiked Tiger Mountain peaks #2 and #3 through the rainforest, climbing to the top to find open panoramic views—Bellevue and Seattle on one side, Mt. Si on the other, with kite flyers down below in the Issaquah Valley. It’s one of those places where peace of mind just settles in.
* Cycled up to Rattlesnake Ledge and Hyak Tunnel through Snoqualmie Pass. Always fun and a challenging. On another day, rode up to Snoqualmie Pass to have lunch at Dru Brew there and returned back through Franklin Falls. Both 90+ mile days in the saddle - great days in the PNW!

## 📅 Sept 18–21 – 📍 Oregon Road Trip:

🏖 Oregon Coast Road Trips

* First night stop in Eugene and met Adrien. Explored downtown with Adrien and enjoyed the local area. Found a fun walking area with a French-themed restaurant, and we walked over to an interesting covered open space that was very charming and had ice cream.
* Next day traveled to Klamath Falls: pickleball tournament, mixed doubles 3.5—Andrea wasn’t feeling 100%. The town was also swarming with midges to the point of being unbearable. 🦟
* Stayed the night at Aunt Gail's super nice new home in Phoenix, near Medford. We were able to get everyone together for a super fun dinner—Adrien, Aunt Gail, and Meranda with family—at El Molcajete Mexican Grill!
* Visited Jacksonville on our way to the coast. This is a preserved Gold Rush town with 19th-century architecture and boutique charm. Had a great breakfast with Adrien at GoodBean Coffee.
* Florence: Entered the town over the famous Siuslaw River Bridge. Fun town and boardwalk area to explore. Had coffee under the bridge, and further up the coast found a classic Oregon picturesque beach to walk around and explore! Andrea tried to save a few jellyfish!
* Newport: Nice town, albeit run-down in the dock area due to lack of commercial fishing operations. Many of the docks were abandoned or in poor condition.We did find an excellent seafood place for dinner: ClearWater
* After Newport, we headed back towards Portland enjoying the fading sun on the surrounding coastline and stay the night. Next day we returned back to Redmond.

## 💼 Career Transition

* On October 14th, SAP’s strategic pivot toward AI led to the elimination of 632 North American and Canadian roles. This forced my immediate retirement! All positive as it is an inflection point—freeing up time to focus fully on my own AI projects, family, and travel.

## 📅 Another visit to 📍 Kelowna

* Oct 30, 2025 - Nov 02, 2025 - quick trip to Kelowna to check in with Darrell
