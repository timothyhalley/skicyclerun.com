**The purpose of using SVG graphics on this website is to preload an image with a visual placeholder while the API to AWS S3 is invoked to retrieve the final image.** 🌟

**Other Benefits**:

1. What Is SVG?

- SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It’s a web standard used to define vector-based graphics within web pages.
- Unlike raster images (such as JPEG or PNG), SVGs are resolution-independent. They maintain crisp quality regardless of their size or display context.
- SVGs are based on XML and provide markup to describe paths, shapes, and text within a viewport1.

2. Why Use SVGs?

- Frontend Optimization: Replacing other image formats with SVGs reduces file size and improves website performance. Inline SVGs don’t require additional HTTP requests.
- Responsive Design: SVGs can adapt to various screen sizes and orientations, making them ideal for responsive web design.
- Consistency: However, rendering SVGs consistently across all browsers can be challenging due to differences in how browsers handle them2.

3. Rendering Differences Across Browsers:

- While SVGs are supported on all modern browsers (including older ones like IE9), their rendering behavior varies.
- The viewbox attribute is crucial for making SVGs responsive. It defines the coordinate system and aspect ratio.
