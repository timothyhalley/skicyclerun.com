The Coachella Valley is known for its wintertime resort cities, popular
destinations for full-time retirees and seasonal residents. It hosts various
annual events, including the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the
Stagecoach Country Music Festival, and the Riverside County Fair and National
Date Festival. The valley is home to cities such as Indio, Palm Springs,
Palm Desert, and Rancho Mirage. 🌴🌵🌞

🐎 The Coachella Valley International Equestrian Center (CVEC), also referred
to as the Thermal Equestrian Center, stands as a prestigious equestrian facility
nestled in the picturesque Coachella Valley, California. As winter descends, 
the center buzzes with activity, drawing horse enthusiasts, riders, and spectators
from around the world. Notably, it entices skilled riders and jumpers with a 
Grand Prix purse exceeding $1,000,000 USD. 🐎🌟
