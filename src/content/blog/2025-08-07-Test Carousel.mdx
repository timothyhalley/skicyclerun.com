🎨 Poem: The Gallery Within: 

In frames of light, the stories gleam,  
A carousel of captured dream.  
Each photo spins—a silent song,  
Where time and color both belong.  

The lens, a brush; the code, a thread,  
We weave the living from the dead.  
A flicker here, a shadow there—  
Art dances in the midnight air.  

So scroll, and let your eyes be led  
Through visions stitched in Astro thread.  
For every pixel, every hue,  
Is memory reborn anew.
