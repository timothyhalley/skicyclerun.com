Westmoreland, Jamaica, holds a poetic distinction: it’s the westernmost parish on the island, and its name reflects that—given by English colonists in 1703 after they took control from the Spanish.

🌿 But beyond geography, Westmoreland is full of hidden gems:

•  Blue Hole Mineral Spring: A turquoise pool tucked into Brighton District, perfect for cliff diving or a serene soak.
•  Roaring River Park: A lush nature reserve with caves, rivers, and natural pools—ideal for exploring Jamaica’s quieter side.
•  Mayfield Falls: Home to 21 natural pools and two waterfalls, surrounded by exotic flora and fauna. It’s a paradise for nature lovers.
