🌌 Programming Languages: Early start to real world applications in the Science and Engineering world

In 1983, I landed a programming role using RatFor on a DEC PDP 11-73 system, translating Bell Labs’ pre-AT&T Fortran routines into maintainable RatFor libraries. These became the backbone for pioneering graphical interfaces in mining and mineral engineering software. Rapidly mastering both Fortran and RatFor, I appreciated RatFor’s elegant syntax and control—an early glimpse into modern language design that emphasized clarity, modularity, and maintainability.

🧠 Elegance, not abstraction

RatFor wasn’t trying to be clever—it was trying to be clear. It didn’t pretend to be a new paradigm or a sentient leap forward. It was a pragmatic refinement: a way to write readable, maintainable code while still compiling down to Fortran. No illusions, just intention. Its intelligence lay in its syntax—if, while, for—bringing structured logic to a world of spaghetti labels and GOTO chaos.

🚀 Acceleration through simplicity

In the early ’80s, RatFor was a quiet revolution. It didn’t need a new machine or a new compiler—just a preprocessor and a better way to think. Suddenly, Fortran programmers could write code that looked like C, but ran like legacy. It lowered the barrier to structured programming and raised the ceiling for maintainability. For those building scientific and engineering software, it was a breath of fresh logic.

🔍 RatFor transformed:

•  Scientific libraries: Wrapping legacy Fortran routines in readable, reusable modules
•  Graphical interfaces: Enabling early visual systems in mining and engineering domains
•  Education: Teaching structured programming without abandoning existing infrastructure
•  Code maintainability: Reducing cognitive load with modern control structures
•  Operational clarity: Making debugging and collaboration dramatically easier

⚖️ Tension between legacy and progress

RatFor lived in the gap between what was and what could be. It respected the power of Fortran but refused its obscurity. It raised questions about compatibility, portability, and the cost of modernization. Was it better to rewrite or refactor? Could elegance coexist with legacy? RatFor didn’t answer those questions—it embodied them.

🌱 A new kind of craftsmanship

RatFor wasn’t flashy. It didn’t promise miracles. But for those who used it, it offered something rare: control. It let developers shape their code with intention, structure, and style. It was a tool, yes—but also a bridge, a refinement, and a quiet manifesto for maintainable software.

RatFor is long gone from most toolchains, but its spirit lives on—in every language that values clarity over cleverness, and every developer who chooses elegance over entropy.
